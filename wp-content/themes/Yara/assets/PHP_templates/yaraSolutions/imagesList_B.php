                <h4>Sentinel-2 Satellites from the European Space Agency </h4>
                <p>Sentinel-2 images capture the red edge of light which gives you insights into the health of
                    your crops and field far before your eyes could notice any anomalies. </p>
                <p>
                    New high-resolution images are added to Atfarm every 3 to 5 days. You can also access 2
                    years of historical field images and biomass maps to track trends. </p>

                <h4>Crop health insights beyond what the human eye can see </h4>
                <p>The N-Sensor vegetation index was developed by Yara agronomists. It is based on more than 25
                    years of field trials and crop modelling.</p>
                <p>Biomass maps created with the N-Sensor index and Sentinel-2 images help you monitor your crop
                    development with more precision than ever before.</p>
