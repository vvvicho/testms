                        <p>“Atfarm is very simple to use, taking just 10 minutes to load all my field boundaries over the 2200 hectares of the farm. I like to use satellite imagery to scout for any management issues.</p>
                        <p>The maps are a very visual way of picking out differences in growth and development to help prioritise decisions. There are plenty of products being developed for farmers, but some do not deliver and I wouldn’t recommend, however, I would recommend farmers to Atfarm.”</p>
