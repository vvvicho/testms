                        <p>Atfarm’s Drive Mode allows you to get the benefits of Variable N-Rate Application with the spreader you already have. GPS technology helps the app guide either your tractor speed or fertiliser flow rate to apply nitrogen with precision across your field.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the task, you can use your computer or smartphone to access all the benefits of Atfarm’s precision farming technology.</p>

                        <h4>Variable speed</h4>
                        <p>Best for: Single-rate spreaders</p>
                        <p>How it works: Set your spreader’s flow rate in the Atfarm app and as you move across your field, you are guided how slow or fast to drive.</p>
                        <p>Your speed adjusts how much fertiliser lands in each area of the field (slower spreads more fertiliser, faster spreads less). </p>

                        <p>Best for: Spreaders with manual flow rate controls</p>
                        <p>How it works: As you drive across your field, the Atfarm app guides you when to change the flow rate of your spreader according to the Variable N-Rate Application map you are using.</p>
