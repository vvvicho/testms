                        <h4>The N-Tester BT</h4>
                        <p>The device uses an LED and light sensor to instantly measure the chlorophyll content of a crop when you clamp it onto the newest fully developed leaf of a crop. This green level shows the N content of the plant. </p>
                        <p>
                            These N-Tester values are automatically sent to your mobile device via Bluetoothâ„¢ connection. No internet or cellular signal is needed to record or take measurements. </p>

                        <h4>The Atfarm App </h4>
                        <p>Atfarm uses an algorithm powered by Yara agronomists to calculate the current N balance of your field based on the N-uptake measurements from the N-Tester BT. Decades of field trials by Yara ensure these calculations are accurate.  </p>
                        <p>All you have to do is enter information about your field: crop type, variety, growth stage, target yield estimate, soil N supply, N already applied. After measuring your crops, you get an N recommendation that shows you the exact N needs of your crops. </p>

                        <h4>Your N-rate recommendation </h4>
                        <p>Open the Atfarm app and easily find the N-rate recommendation for your crops (shown in kilos of nitrogen per hectare). </p>

                        <p>The N-rate recommendations from the N-Tester BT are designed to help fine-tune N-applications during the growing season and help you maximise the yield return for every kilo of N you apply. </p>
